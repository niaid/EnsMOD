EnsMOD Input Table: Supplemental Table 4 - Phosphopeptide Quantitation Values.
The data were globally normalized by dividing the abundance values with the GlobalNormAbundance values.
Then the data were Log10-transformed.

EnsMOD Input Table - Proteome: Table S4 "InfernoRDN results from the analysis of the proteome data subset".
     The data were Log2-transformed.
EnsMOD Input Table - Transcriptome: Table S3 "InfernoRDN results from the analysis of the transcriptome data subset".
     The transcriptome dataset was run in two ways
     EnsMOD v2.0 (unaltered): Ensemble_Methods_for_Outlier_Detection_v2_0.html
     EnsMOD v2.0 (altered to use normal (i.e., unmodified) Z-scores): Ensemble_Methods_for_Outlier_Detection_v2_0-UnmodifiedZ.html
          There was only one modification: deletion of "# " at the start of line 110 using RStudio.
          This enabled: "input_data_nna_ModZ <- t(scale(t(input_data_nna), center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))"
          Modified Z-scores are robust to outliers (Iglewicz and Hoaglin 1993), but can cause artifacts.

EnsMOD input = "Proteins-processed.csv" (this file is described in the article)
     Each protein was required to have at least one peptide that had at least 20% (298 of 1490) valid (not missing) values.
          "Peptides-raw.csv" was used to calculate this (this file is described in the article).



Simulated Proteomics Data:
The data were made using Microsoft Excel.
